# Patient-Management-System

## Background 

XU Hospital needs an electronic patient management system to manage the visits of their patients. The system should allow the hospital staff to manage patientsâ€™ appointments besides admitting and discharging patients. The deployment of the new system will be rolled-out in three phases. Phase 1: core business logic with command line interface; Phase 2: Desktop Graphical User Interface deployed; Phase 3: Web-based interface deployed. In the context of this event, we will focus on phase 1 only. 

## System Requirements 

Here are some of the basic system requirements: 

1. Admit new patients for treatment. Basic patient information is required. 

2. Discharge patients (whose treatments have been completed) with a brief description (protocol) 

3. Appointment management:  

   1. Make a new appointment 

   2. Cancel an existing appointment (with an optional explanation) 

   3. Display appointment(s) for a patient 

4. Lookup patient by name  

5. Lookup patient by health insurance number 

6. Display discharged patients on a particular day (with discharge notes) 

7. Optional: Export patient data to CSV file 

## Hints 

### Hint 1: specifications 

The specifications of patient data and the details of the involved business processes can be set by the development team for the current phase. Ensure proper documentation and proper communication of decisions with the entire team to remain aligned and interoperable. 

### Hint 2: Software Analysis and Design 

Do not start coding right away. Invest enough time to analyze the problem and design a solution first. At least, a class diagram is required before starting coding. 

### Hint 3: Teamwork 

Based on the developed model / design of your system, distribute the work among the different groups ensuring having agreements on common interfaces / interactions.  

### Hint 4: Codebase Management 

To ensure interoperability among the different parts (done by different groups), we will use GitHub to centrally manage our codebase. There will be a central repository with multiple forks (one fork per group). Once a feature is ready, please push (upload) your code and open a pull request against the main repository (i.e., request pulling your code changes into the main repository). The pull requests and integration will be handled by your coach. 

### Hint 5: Creativity and Innovation 

Feel free to bring in any innovative and creative ideas to the system after completing the required core features. Make sure your ideas fit in the overall design / model. Ensure proper and clean documentation and communication of your ideas.
